# recursive-open-struct

OpenStruct subclass that returns nested hash attributes as
RecursiveOpenStructs.

It allows for hashes within hashes to be called in a chain of methods:

    ros = RecursiveOpenStruct.new( { fooa: { foob: 'fooc' } } )

    ros.fooa.foob # => 'fooc'

Also, if needed, nested hashes can still be accessed as hashes:

    ros.fooa_as_a_hash # { foob: 'fooc' }

RecursiveOpenStruct can also optionally recurse across arrays, although you
have to explicitly enable it:

    h = { :somearr => [ { name: 'a'}, { name: 'b' } ] }
    ros = RecursiveOpenStruct.new(h, recurse_over_arrays: true )

    ros.somearr[0].name # => 'a'
    ros.somearr[1].name # => 'b'

Also, by default it will turn all hash keys into symbols internally:

    h = { 'fear' => 'is', 'the' => 'mindkiller' } }
    ros = RecursiveOpenStruct.new(h)
    ros.to_h # => { fear: 'is', the: 'mindkiller' }

You can preserve the original keys by enabling `:preserve_original_keys`:

    h = { 'fear' => 'is', 'the' => 'mindkiller' } }
    ros = RecursiveOpenStruct.new(h, preserve_original_keys: true)
    ros.to_h # => { 'fear' => 'is', 'the' => 'mindkiller' }

When subclassing RecursiveOpenStruct the subclass with be used for recursion,
so nested elements will also be of subclass. However this means that custom
initialize methods are also being invoked for each recursion.
You can prevent that by enabling `:recursive_ostruct_class`:

    h = { one: { two: 'three' } } }
    s = YourSubclass.new(h, recursive_ostruct_class: true)
    s.class.name # => YourSubclass
    s.one.class.name # => RecursiveOpenStruct
